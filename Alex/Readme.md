Abstract, My work so far:
Created a GPT ( Musculoskeletal Disorders Assistant) and now feeding it with articles. The main information for starting the project is a multifaceted exploration of musculoskeletal disorders, with a particular focus on the ankle joint complex, deep squat movements, and the interconnections of superior peroneal retinaculum to adjacent lateral ankle structures. These documents provide a deep dive into the biomechanics of ankle mobility, the effects of various exercises on joint range of motion, and the intricate anatomy relevant to musculoskeletal disorders. One study meticulously developed a method to quantify the range of motion of the ankle joint complex in vivo, highlighting the significance of plantarflexion, inversion, and abduction movements in age-related changes. Another research emphasized the relationship between deep squat movements and the range of motion and muscle strength in the hip, knee, and ankle joints, suggesting that certain joint motions can significantly predict squatting depth and posture. Furthermore, an anatomical study detailed the variations and connections of the superior peroneal retinaculum to adjacent structures, offering insights into potential implications for injury and rehabilitation. These studies collectively contribute to a better understanding of how specific exercises and movements impact joint health and functionality. They underscore the importance of considering anatomical variations in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, as well as the need for tailored rehabilitation programs to address individual differences in joint mobility and strength. The insights from these documents are pivotal for clinicians, therapists, and individuals seeking to optimize musculoskeletal health through informed exercise and rehabilitation practices.
In total i have read around 47 different articles, being specific about the ankle joint. Nest step is to be more specific about the knee and hip movements.

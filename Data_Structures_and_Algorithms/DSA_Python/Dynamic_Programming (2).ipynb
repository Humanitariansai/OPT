        "Overlapping subproblems is a property of a problem where smaller subproblems recur multiple times during the computation. Dynamic programming takes advantage of this property by solving each subproblem once and storing its result, thereby avoiding redundant calculations and significantly improving efficiency.\n",

        "\n",
        "In problems that exhibit overlapping subproblems, the naive recursive solution repeatedly solves the same subproblems, leading to inefficiency. Dynamic programming (DP) addresses this by using two main techniques: memoization and tabulation.\n",

        "1. **Memoization (Top-Down Approach)**:\n",
        "   - This approach involves recursively breaking down the problem and storing the results of subproblems in a memoization table (usually a hash table or array).\n",
        "   - When a subproblem is encountered again, the stored result is used instead of recomputing it.\n",

        "   - A data structure (typically a dictionary or an array) is used to store the results of subproblems.\n",
        "   - Before solving a subproblem, the algorithm checks if the result is already in the memoization table.\n",
        "   - If the result is found in the table, it is returned immediately (a cache hit), avoiding the need for recomputation.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Implement the Top-Down Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define the Recursive Function**:\n",

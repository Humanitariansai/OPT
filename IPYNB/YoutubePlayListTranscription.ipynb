    "*   It is designed to handle playlists of any size, with an option to limit the number of videos processed.\n",
    "*   The process involves downloading the audio tracks of selected YouTube videos, splitting large audio files into smaller, manageable chunks based on periods of silence, and then using speech recognition technology to convert these audio chunks into written text.\n",

Sometime when you were a kid maybe say third grader so you learned an algorithm for multiplying two numbers. For transforming an input namely two numbers. Into an out. Error: Let's pause and be precise about it. So that is an algorithm for solving a computational problem. Many of the lectures in this course will follow a pattern. Will define a computational problem will say what the input is and then we'll say what the desired output is. Then we will proceed to giving a solution to giving an algorithm that transforms the input into the output. When the integer multiplication problem the input is just two n digit numbers. So the length in of the two input integers x and y could be anything. But for motivation you might want to think of n is large in the thousands or even more perhaps were implementing some kind of cryptographic application which has to manipulate very large numbers. We also need to explain what is the desired output in this simple problem it's simply the product. X * y. Many people tell me you know by the end of the course they think of it fondly as a sort of acquired tast. Do a quick digression so back in third grade around the same time i was learning this integer multiplication algorithm i got a c in penmanship and i don't think my handwriting has improved much since. If you don't want to take the time deciphering the. But if you're feeling impatient please note there are typed versions of these slides which i encourage you to use as you go through the. Returning to the integer multiplication problem. Namely the same algorithm you learn. In third grade. Having now specified the problem precisely the input the desired output will move on to discussing an algorithm. The way we will assess the performance of this algorithm. Is through the number of basic operations that it perform. We're going to then move on to counting. The number of these basic operations performed. And for the moment let's think of a basic operation as simply adding to single digit numbers together or multiplying to single digit numbers. Buy the 3rd grade algorithm. As a function. Of the number. Of digits in the input. Here is the integer multiplication algorithm that you learned back in 3rd grade. Illustrated on a concrete example let's take say the numbers 1234. And 5678. Four digits. As we go through this algorithm quickly let me remind you that our focus should be on the number of basic operations this algorithm performs as a function of the length of the input. Tara recall we just compute one partial product for each digit of the second number. So we start by just multiplying four times the upper number 5678. When we do the next partial product we do a shift effectively we add a zero at the end and then we just do exactly the same thing. So you know 4 * 8 is 32 233 * 7 is 28 with the 3 that's 31 right down the one carry the three and so on. And so on for the final two partial products. And finally we just add everything up. Well you probably realized back in third grade is that this algorithm is what we would call correct. And all of your intermediate computations are done properly. That is no matter what integers x and y you start with if you carry out this procedure this algorithm. You're never going to get a wrong answer you always going to get the actual product. Then the algorithm will eventually terminate with the product x * y of the two input numbers. Well you probably didn't think about. Determination. That is the number of basic operations. What was the amount of time needed to carry this algorithm out to its conclusion. Before finishing. Additions or multiplications of single digit numbers needed. Let's begin with the first partial product the top. How did we compute this number 2271. So let's now quickly give an informal analysis of the number of operations required as a function of the input length. Error: Four basic oper. When's one for each digit of the top number. Will we multiply 4 times each of the numbers 567 and 8. But in any case this is at most. Plus we had to do these carrie so those were some extra edition. Twice times the number of digits in the first. At most two end basic operations. Deform this first partial product. And if you think about it there's nothing special about the first partial product. The same argument says that we needed most to an operations. To form each of the partial product. Of which there are again in one for each digit of the second. To form all of these blue numbers all of the partial products. Well if we need it most to an operations to compute each partial product and we have n partial products that's a total of it most 2n squared operations. Now we're not done at that point we still have to add all of those up. Roughly another say 2n squared at most oper. To get the final answer in this case 7,000,006,652 and that's final edition requires a comparable number of oper. The number of operations that the grade school. Multiplication algorithm performs. So the upshot the high-level point that i want you to focus on is that as we think about the input numbers getting bigger and bigger that is as a function of n the number of digits in the input numbers. Times in. Grows like some constant roughly for say. In the input length. That is its quadratic. Then the number of operations you will have to perform using this algorithm. Cast to go up by a factor of four. For example if you double the size of the input if you double the number of digits in each of the two integers that you're given. Similarly if you quadruple the input l. The number of operations is going to go up by a factor of 16. And so on. Now depending on what type of third grader you. You might well have accepted this procedure as the unique. Or at least the optimal way. Of multiplying two numbers together. Error: Now if you want to be a serious algorithm designer that kind of obedient timidity is a quality you're going to have to grow out of. An early and extremely important textbook on the design and analysis of algorithms was by ajo hotp. Error: And there's the following quote which i absolutely adore. So after iterating through a number of the algorithm design par. What is covered in the textbook. They say the following. For the good algorithm design. Perhaps the most important principle of all. Conte. Is to refuse to be. And i think this is a spot on comments. I might summarize it a little bit more succinctly. Error: The question. Can we do better. As an algorithm designer you should adopt as your mantra. Like for example. This question is particularly apropos when you're faced with a naive or straightforward solution to a computational problem. The third grade algorithm for integer multiplication. A question you perhaps did not ask yourself in third grade was. And. Can we do better than the straightforward multiplication algorithm. Is the time. \n",

# The persona Pattern

**Objective**: The goal of this assignment is to explore and understand the Persona Pattern in Prompt Engineering. This pattern involves crafting prompts that give a large language model (LLM) a specific "persona" or character, which can influence the style, tone, and type of information provided in its responses.

## Task:

Understand the Persona Pattern: Briefly research what the Persona Pattern is in the context of prompt engineering. Understand how giving a language model a specific character or 'persona' can influence its responses.

- **Create a Simple Persona**: Design one simple persona,  For example, a persona could be a 'Co-op Advisor'. Note down key characteristics such as being knowledgeable about career development, experienced in advising students, empathetic, and equipped with practical industry insights.
- **Develop and Test a Prompt**: Create a single prompt that fits your Co-op Advisor persona. For instance, ask your 'Co-op Advisor' for tips on how to make the most out of a co-op placement in a new city. Use a large language model like ChatGPT, Bard to test your prompt.
- **Observe and Reflect**: Note how the response aligns with the persona of a Co-op Advisor. Reflect on how the persona may have influenced the style and content of the response.
- **Short Reflection**: Write a few sentences on what you observed and how you think the Persona Pattern could be useful in practical applications.

Assignment Title: Understanding Prompt Engineering

Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to help students grasp the concept of prompt engineering in the context of natural language processing and demonstrate their understanding through a motivating example.

Instructions:

Part 1: Explain Prompt Engineering (roughly 300-400 words)

In this part of the assignment, you are required to provide a comprehensive explanation of what prompt engineering is and why it is important in the field of natural language processing and machine learning. Your explanation should cover the following points:

- Define Prompt Engineering: Begin by defining prompt engineering in your own words. Explain its purpose and significance.

Part 2: Create a Motivating Example (200-250 words)

In this part of the assignment, you will provide a motivating example that illustrates the concept of prompt engineering. Your example should demonstrate how different prompts can lead to distinct outcomes when interacting with a language model. Consider the following:

- Choose a scenario: Select a specific scenario or task where language models can be applied, such as a chatbot, question-answering system, or language translation.
- Craft two or more prompts: Create at least two distinct prompts that guide the language model to generate responses related to the chosen scenario.
- Show the contrast: Present the responses generated by the language model for each of the prompts and explain the differences in the output.
- Reflect on the impact: Discuss how prompt engineering influenced the outcomes in your example and why one prompt may have been more effective or appropriate than the others.

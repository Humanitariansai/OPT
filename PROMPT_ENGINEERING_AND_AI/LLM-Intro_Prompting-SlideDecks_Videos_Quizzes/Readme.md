## Project Overview
This project is dedicated to developing an educational suite focusing on the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLM) and their application in prompt engineering. Through engaging slide decks, informative videos, and interactive quizzes, we aim to enhance understanding and foster practical skills in utilizing LLMs.

## Objectives
- Demystify the principles and functionalities of Large Language Models.
- Provide hands-on examples of effective prompt creation for LLMs.
- Engage learners with multimedia content to solidify their understanding of key concepts.
- Illustrate the real-world impact and applications of LLMs through case studies and use cases.

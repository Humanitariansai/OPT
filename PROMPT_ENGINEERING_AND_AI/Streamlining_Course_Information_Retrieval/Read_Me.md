This Application allows you to upload your own set of documents and and receive accurate responses to your inquiries through the advanced GPT-4 model. 




# Introduction:

The project is to develop a user-friendly application tailored for students seeking easy access to course-related information. 
Users will be able to upload their own documents, ask questions on and receive concise, accurate responses from those documents.
Leveraging advanced technologies like semantic search and Large Language Models (LLM).

# Objective:

•	Developing a scalable and efficient platform for document-based question answering.
•	Implementing state-of-the-art NLP algorithms for text analysis, document parsing, and answer extraction.
•	Enhancing the system's performance through continuous optimization and refinement of machine learning models.
•	Providing users with a seamless and intuitive interface for querying documents and accessing extracted answers.


# Proposed Methodology:

The approach involves combining Pinecone, a robust vector database engine, with LLM, known for its natural language understanding capabilities. By integrating these technologies, The aim is to improve the search functionality of this application, enabling it to understand and answer diverse queries accurately. This not only enhances the versatility of the platform but also makes it intelligent in interpreting and responding to user questions.

# Scope:

The project focuses on developing a user-friendly application tailored for students seeking easy access to course-related information. Users will be able to submit queries on specific subjects or topics and receive concise, accurate responses. The system will enhance overall learning experience. While the initial focus is on academic settings, the scalability of the solution allows for potential applications across various domains.


# Conclusion:

In conclusion, the project represents a significant step forward in improving the educational experience through technology. By leveraging semantic search and Large Language Models, we aim to empower students with a dynamic platform that simplifies information retrieval and fosters deeper understanding. The commitment to delivering a user-friendly, effective solution underscores the dedication to advancing education in the digital age.

## Introduction
The integration of prompt engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) in medical diagnosis represents a paradigm shift in healthcare delivery. With the promise of enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and patient outcomes, this case study delves into the transformative potential of these innovative approaches. Through a comprehensive review of existing research literature such as PubMed, analysis of case studies, and examination of real-world implementations, this study will delve into specific examples such as the use of AI for early detection of cancer and the application of prompt engineering principles in improving diagnostic accuracy, AI-powered patient care by using AI virtual healthcare assistance, AI mental health support and AI in patient education and cost optimization. By providing concrete examples of prompt engineering's application in healthcare settings and clarifying its distinct role alongside broader AI applications, we aim to underscore its unique contributions and illuminate the path toward a more precise, patient-centered, and ethically responsible approach to medical diagnosis.

## Problem Statements
In the realm of medical diagnostics, significant challenges persist, ranging from diagnostic errors to the timely detection and interpretation of complex medical data. With diagnostic errors accounting for a substantial portion of medical mishaps and associated mortality rates, there is a pressing need for more efficient and accurate diagnostic methods. As highlighted by Taylor [3], diagnostic errors account for a staggering 60% of all medical errors in U.S. hospitals, resulting in an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 deaths annually. The imperative to reduce these errors has spurred the adoption of AI-based technologies across various healthcare fields, aiming to augment human judgment and improve diagnostic accuracy. This case study addresses these challenges head-on, seeking to harness the power of prompt engineering and AI to streamline diagnostic processes, improve diagnostic accuracy, and ultimately enhance patient care. Through an exploration of interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations, we aim to provide insights into how these innovative technologies can address critical gaps in medical diagnosis while navigating complex ethical and regulatory landscapes.
